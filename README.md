# Teamweek button

## Requirements
You need to have node.js and npm installed. That's it.

## Building
We use Gulp as a build system, Browserify to compile our JS files and LESS for stylesheets. 

To build scripts and styles, run `npm run-script build`. To watch for changes in scripts and styles run `npm run-script watch`.

The extension files are in the `app` directory. You can open this directory from chrome using the "Load unpacked extension" button.
